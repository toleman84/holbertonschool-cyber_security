## 🛠️ Project Description

This repository houses my cybersecurity learnings and progress during my time at Holberton School. It is designed to cover a variety of security areas, including:

- **Script development** for network and vulnerability analysis.
- **Attack simulation** in controlled environments.
- **Active defenses**, such as firewall configurations and threat detection.
- **Exploitation and mitigation of common vulnerabilities**.

Each directory contains a specific topic with practical examples, commented code, and interactive exercises.

## 🚀 Development History

My journey in cybersecurity started with basic concepts like networking and cryptography. As I progressed through the program, I dove into more complex tasks, such as vulnerability exploitation and traffic analysis. It was exciting to build custom tools and simulate real attacks in controlled environments.

A key part of my learning was collaborating with peers and sharing ideas on how to approach problems efficiently and ethically.

## ✨ Features Implemented

### Completed
- Bash scripts for network scanning with Nmap and ARP.
- Wireshark traffic filtering for anomaly detection.
- Exploiting vulnerabilities in Linux systems and web applications.
- Basic firewall configuration in Ubuntu.
- SQL and NoSQL injection in controlled environments.

### To be implemented
- Custom tools for forensic analysis.
- Simulations of social engineering-based attacks.
- Improve documentation with detailed flow diagrams.

## 😅 Challenges Encountered

1. **Managing virtualized environments:** Properly configuring virtual machines and networks for simulations was an initial challenge.
2. **Debugging complex scripts:** Detecting errors in Bash and Python scripts designed for automated analysis forced me to improve my debugging skills.
3. **Advanced SQL injections:** Achieving efficient injections in robust databases such as SQLite and MongoDB led me to investigate and practice in more depth.
