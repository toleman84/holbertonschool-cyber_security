        end (int): The ending address of the memory range to read.

        SystemExit: Terminates the program if an error occurs while access mem

    Details:
        - The file `/proc/<pid>/mem` provides access to the process mem space
        - The script must be run with superuser privileges to access this file
        - The function calculates the read range as `end - start` and uses

def write_memory(pid, start, data):

    Writes data to a specific memory address range of a given process.

    Args:
        pid (int): The process ID whose memory space is to be modified.
        start (int): The starting address in the memory range where the
        data will be written.
        data (bytes): The data to be written into the specified memory range.

    Raises:
        PermissionError: If the script lacks the necessary permissions
        to access the process's memory file.
        SystemExit: Terminates the program if an error occurs during the memory
        write operation.

    Details:
        - The function accesses the `/proc/<pid>/mem` file to modify the memory
        of the process.
        - Superuser privileges are required to write to this file.
        - The `file.seek()` method is used to move to the specified starting
        address before writing the data.

    Example:
        >>> write_memory(1234, 0x7ff123400000, b'HelloWorld')
        This writes the string "HelloWorld" as bytes into the process memory
        starting at the given address.

    Notes:
        - The `data` must not exceed the available writable memory range
        starting from `start`.
        - Ensure the memory range being modified is safe to access and wonâ€™t
        cause unexpected behavior in the process.

    Searches for a specific string in the heap of a process and replaces it

        be modified.
        search_string (str): The string to search for in the heap.

        SystemExit: Terminates the program if an error occurs during the

    Details:
        - This function searches for the `search_string` in the heap memory of
        the specified process and replaces it with the `replace_string`.
        - The heap memory is accessed via the `/proc/<pid>/mem` interface.
        - The function ensures that the `replace_string` is not longer than
        the `search_string` to prevent memory overflows.
        - It uses the `find_heap()` function to get the heap's memory address
        range and then reads the heap data to locate the `search_string`.

    Example:
        >>> replace_string_in_heap(1234, "old_string", "new_string")
