# Severity in CVE

The definition of the severity of CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) plays a key role in prioritizing security measures in an organization. Vulnerabilities are classified into severity levels (low, medium, high, critical), and each level affects risk mitigation strategies. The following describes how the severity levels impact responses:

## Low Severity
Example: Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability that requires active user interaction.
Impact: Limited, does not compromise data or execute malicious code.
Strategy: Long-term correction, no urgency.

## Medium Severity
Example: Vulnerability in a website that discloses non-sensitive information.
Impact: Exposure of information that could aid a future attack.
Strategy: Corrected in the next scheduled update.

## High Severity
Example: Vulnerability in a server that allows remote code execution (RCE) under certain conditions.
Impact: Requires specific conditions, but can be exploited by advanced attackers.
Strategy: Immediate response, with emergency patches.

## Critical Severity
Example: Vulnerability in an operating system that allows remote code execution without authentication (such as in Apache Log4j).
Impact: Allows full control of the system by attackers.
Strategy: Urgent action, with immediate patches and temporary solutions if necessary.

## Influence on Response
Critical Vulnerabilities: Immediate response, with urgent patch management and alerts to users.
High Vulnerabilities: Require active monitoring and temporary mitigation until the patch is applied.
Medium and Low Vulnerabilities: Managed in regular maintenance cycles.

## Conclusion
Prioritization depends on the level of risk. Critical vulnerabilities require rapid and coordinated responses, while lower severity vulnerabilities are addressed in a planned manner. Tools such as CVE and vulnerability management systems (e.g. CVSS) help to allocate resources and mitigate risks effectively.
