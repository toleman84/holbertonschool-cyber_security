# Common CWEs

## **1. CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (Cross-site Scripting - XSS)**

**Impact**: This weakness occurs when an application does not properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. XSS can lead to data theft, session hijacking, and unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
**Prioritization**:

- **High priority**: XSS vulnerabilities should be addressed immediately, especially if the application handles sensitive data or allows user interactions such as login or financial transactions. Mitigating XSS is crucial for protecting user data and ensuring the integrity of the web application.

## **2. CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (SQL Injection)**

**Impact**: SQL injection allows attackers to manipulate the backend database by injecting malicious SQL queries through input fields. This can result in unauthorized access to data, data modification, or even complete system compromise.
**Prioritization**:

- **Critical priority**: SQL injection vulnerabilities are highly dangerous, especially if they allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or can be used to escalate privileges. They should be fixed immediately, and secure coding practices such as using prepared statements and parameterized queries should be enforced.

## **3. CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Buffer Overflow')**

**Impact**: A buffer overflow occurs when data exceeds the allocated buffer space, potentially overwriting memory and allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code. This can result in system crashes, unauthorized access, or remote code execution.
**Prioritization**:

- **High priority**: Buffer overflows can have severe consequences, including the potential for arbitrary code execution. If found in critical software, such as operating systems or network services, they should be addressed immediately by implementing proper input validation and bounds checking.

## **4. CWE-287: Improper Authentication**

**Impact**: Improper authentication can allow unauthorized users to gain access to an application or system. This can result in the exposure of sensitive data, privilege escalation, or unauthorized actions by malicious actors.
**Prioritization**:

- **High priority**: Authentication issues are critical because they directly impact access control. It's vital to implement strong, multi-factor authentication mechanisms and secure password storage techniques to prevent unauthorized access.

## **5. CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write**

**Impact**: This occurs when a program writes data outside the bounds of allocated memory, potentially leading to data corruption or remote code execution. This can lead to serious security vulnerabilities and system instability.
**Prioritization**:

- **High priority**: Out-of-bounds writes are a severe security concern, especially when dealing with critical system components or applications with elevated privileges. They should be addressed early in the development process with proper bounds checking and memory management techniques.

## **6. CWE-200: Information Exposure**

**Impact**: Information exposure occurs when sensitive data is inadvertently exposed, such as through error messages or improperly configured access controls. This can lead to data leakage and provide attackers with information that can be used for further exploitation.
**Prioritization**:

- **Medium priority**: While not always as immediately dangerous as injection or buffer overflow issues, information exposure should be fixed to prevent attackers from gathering intelligence. Sensitive data should be protected, and error messages should be generic to avoid revealing internal system details.

## **7. CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**

**Impact**: Path traversal vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to access files outside the intended directory, which can lead to unauthorized file access or data manipulation.
**Prioritization**:

- **Medium priority**: Path traversal vulnerabilities should be addressed promptly but may not be as critical as other vulnerabilities like SQL injection or buffer overflows. They can often be mitigated through proper input validation and by using secure libraries that prevent directory traversal.
