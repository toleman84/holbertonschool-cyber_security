# Analyzing Vulnerability Trends

In 2024, a significant increase in the number of vulnerabilities identified in the Linux kernel has been observed. According to an article by Open Source Security, the number of vulnerability identifiers (CVE) assigned to the Linux kernel has grown considerably, raising concerns about the management and mitigation of these vulnerabilities

To analyze vulnerability trends in the Linux kernel during this year, a search was performed on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) filtering by "Linux kernel" and limiting the results to vulnerabilities discovered in 2024. The data collected shows an increase in the number of vulnerabilities reported in the first two quarters of the year, with a decrease in the third quarter.

This pattern suggests that although vulnerability discovery activity in the Linux kernel was high in the first months of 2024, the mitigation measures implemented could have reduced the emergence of new vulnerabilities in subsequent quarters.

It is essential for organizations to keep their systems up to date and apply security patches in a timely manner to mitigate the risks associated with these vulnerabilities.
